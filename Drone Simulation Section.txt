Drone Simulation Section
In this section, we'll outline how to simulate a drone that visits identified crime hotspots using a grid-based approach and simple path planning algorithms.

1. Creating a Grid (3D Frame)
We divide the area into uniform grid cells, for example, 1 km x 1 km squares. Each cell represents a possible patrol region. Crime hotspots detected from the classification model are assigned as Points of Interest (POIs) within these grid cells.

2. Assigning Hotspots as POIs
Using the geographic coordinates of identified hotspots, map each hotspot to its corresponding grid cell. These POIs become waypoints the drone must visit.

3. Generating Waypoints and Path Planning
Lawnmower Pattern: The drone flies back and forth in a systematic pattern covering all grid cells containing hotspots. This ensures full coverage.

Nearest Neighbor Traversal: Starting from a base location, the drone visits the closest remaining hotspot POI iteratively until all are covered, optimizing for minimal travel distance.

4. Example Python Pseudocode for Waypoint Generation
python
# Define grid boundaries and cell size
grid_size = 1  # km
# Sample hotspot coordinates (latitude, longitude)
hotspots = [(34.05, -118.25), (34.06, -118.24), (34.07, -118.26)]

# Placeholder function to assign grid cells (simplified)
def assign_grid_cell(lat, lon, grid_size):
    # Convert lat/lon to grid cell indices
    cell_x = int(lat / grid_size)
    cell_y = int(lon / grid_size)
    return (cell_x, cell_y)

grid_cells = [assign_grid_cell(lat, lon, grid_size) for lat, lon in hotspots]

# Generate a simple lawnmower path covering these cells
path = []
# Sort grid_cells by x, then y (basic lawnmower traversal)
grid_cells_sorted = sorted(grid_cells, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
for cell in grid_cells_sorted:
    path.append(cell)

print("Waypoints for drone to visit:", path)
5. Flying and Controlling the Drone
Controlling a real drone requires GPS waypoints and flight commands. Python libraries such as DroneKit or DJI SDK enable:

Uploading waypoint missions

Real-time monitoring

Flight control commands (takeoff, hover, land)

The droneâ€™s autopilot receives GPS coordinates and follows the planned path with safety checks. Obstacle avoidance and flight adjustments depend on the drone hardware capabilities and sensors.
